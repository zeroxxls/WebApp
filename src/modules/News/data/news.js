      articleDescription:`On this Earth Day, we’re proud to celebrate the beauty of our planet which inspired the moon of Pandora from the prominent Avatar films. We are excited to unveil some new art and show to the world how our game has evolved since launch. 

A little over a year ago, we released Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora™, welcoming players to explore the stunning Western Frontier, a never-seen-before continent of Pandora developed by Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, in collaboration with Disney and Lightstorm Entertainment. The response from players has been incredible, and we were thrilled to continue expanding the world of Avatar through two additional story packs: The Sky Breaker and Secrets of the Spires. These additions allowed us to keep breathing life into uncharted regions of Pandora, introducing new flora, fauna, and iconic landmarks.

The Sky Breaker invites players to join the Na’vi Great Games, hosted by the Zeswa Clan in the depths of the yet-to-be-discovered Heart of the Plains, where they can ride their direhorse alongside the magnificent zakru migration. Here, familiar environments have blossomed into breathtaking new variations, while new biomes such as the Prism Fields, Feathered Grasslands, and Stone Rapids offer fresh, exhilarating experiences. This story pack showcases the Zeswa Clan during their famous festivities and adds a looming threat from the RDA.

Secrets of the Spires takes players to the Spires of the Clouded Forest, a mountainous, unexplored region filled with deep canyons and high peaks. We meticulously designed the aerial environment to be captivating and engaging by adding exciting new Pandoran flora and new airborne RDA threats. Our team embarked on a mission: to craft a region that would spark players’ curiosity. The Spires, with their majestic peaks reaching toward the heavens, beckoned us. And what better way to traverse such verticality than atop one’s very own Ikran? 

We are once again excited to share with this community additional art from Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. We invite you to lose yourselves into Pandora, explore our artistic endeavors, and get immersed in the breathtaking world we’ve created. We hope our behind-the-scenes collection of artworks will inspire you to dream and invent worlds of your own.

From the passionate Art teams at Massive Entertainment, Ubisoft Reflections, Ubisoft Leamington and Ubisoft Shanghai.`,
